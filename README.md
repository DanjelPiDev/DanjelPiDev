### About Me
I develop full-stack systems by day and build strange, experimental AI projects by night.

This GitHub is where I explore everything from emotion-aware spiking neural networks and auto-updating LLMs, to low-level backup bots and Unreal Engine prototypes. Some of it works. Some of it breaks beautifully.
Most of what you see here wasn't made for show, it was built to learn something new or prove that it could be done. Sometimes both.

If you're here to find polished SaaS clones, you're in the wrong repo.

If you're into complex systems, weird architecture, and slightly unhinged passion projects... Welcome.
